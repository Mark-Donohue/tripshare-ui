# TripShare UI

This is the front-end UI application for TripShare. It is written using [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Running Locally

To run TripShare UI locally, please have [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) installed on your machine. Once installed, execute the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

TripShare UI is dependent on [TripShare API](https://github.com/Mark-Donohue/tripshare-api). In order for the UI to function properly, the API must be running as well. To set up and run the API locally, please follow the instructions listed in the TripShare API README file.
